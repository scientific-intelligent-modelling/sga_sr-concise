### Analysis of Good Expressions

#### Good Expression 1: \( x0 \cdot x2^{3/2} \)
- **Functional Relationship**: This is a product of a polynomial term \( x0 \) and a power law term \( x2^{3/2} \). 
- **Pattern**: There is no subtraction, logarithm, or transcendental functions involved. Itâ€™s a straightforward multiplicative combination of variables with integer or fractional exponents.

#### Good Expression 2: \( x0 \cdot (x8 \cdot x10)^{-1} \)
- **Functional Relationship**: This can be rewritten as \( x0 / (x8 \cdot x10) \), which is a rational function and also represents multiplicative inverse relationships.
- **Pattern**: It avoids addition or subtraction within the expression. It maintains a purely multiplicative or divisional structure.

#### Good Expression 3: \( x2^2 \cdot (x0 / x3) \)
- **Functional Relationship**: This is a product of a polynomial term \( x2^2 \) and a rational function \( x0 / x3 \).
- **Pattern**: Similar to other good expressions, it maintains the pattern of multiplicative combinations without any additive, subtractive, logarithmic, or transcendental functions.

#### Good Expression 4: \( (x2 \cdot x0) \cdot x8^{1/2} \)
- **Functional Relationship**: This is a product of polynomial terms \( x2 \cdot x0 \) and a power law term \( x8^{1/2} \).
- **Pattern**: Continues the trend of multiplicative relationships, only involving simple powers or polynomials.

#### Good Expression 5: \( x2 \cdot (x0 \cdot x10^3) \)
- **Functional Relationship**: This is a product of polynomial terms \( x2 \) and \( x0 \), and a term in the form \( x10^3 \).
- **Pattern**: The expression maintains a purely multiplicative structure with integer powers without introducing any other operations.

### Analysis of Bad Expressions

#### Bad Expression 1: \( x2 \cdot (x0 - (\log(x8 \cdot x10) / x3)) \)
- **Functional Relationship**: Involves a logarithmic function nested inside a rational function, and then combined with subtraction.
- **Pattern**: Use of subtraction and logarithms, adding complexity and non-linearity that breaks the patterns seen in good expressions.

#### Bad Expression 2: \( x2 \cdot (\log(x3) + (x0 - \sqrt{x8})) \)
- **Functional Relationship**: Combination of logarithmic and square root functions alongside addition and subtraction.
- **Pattern**: Introduction of logarithms and square roots, and the use of addition/subtraction makes it distinct from good expressions.

#### Bad Expression 3: \( (x0 - (\sqrt{x8} / x3)) \cdot x2 \)
- **Functional Relationship**: Contains a square root function combined with divisions and subtraction.
- **Pattern**: Presence of non-multiplicative operations like subtraction and square roots marks it as different.

#### Bad Expression 4: \( x2 \cdot (x0 - \sin(\log(x8))) \)
- **Functional Relationship**: Combination of a logarithmic function inside a sine function, followed by subtraction.
- **Pattern**: Use of transcendental functions like sine and logarithm combined with subtraction is a key differentiator from good expressions.

#### Bad Expression 5: \( x2 \cdot (x0 - \log(x8)) \)
- **Functional Relationship**: Involves subtraction of a logarithmic function.
- **Pattern**: Introducing subtraction and logs shows a clear departure from the purely multiplicative nature of the good expressions.
