### Context

This is a physical simulation environment. The physical simulation is built based on the Material Point Method. The objective of this problem is to fill in a code block so that the result from executing the code matches the ground-truth result. The code block defines the constitutive law behind the physical simulation. The code block defines a class with two functions that divide the code into a continuous part that defines the differentiable parameters and a discrete part that defines the symbolic constitutive law. The input to the symbolic constitutive law is the deformation gradient, and the output is the Kirchhoff stress tensor. States that capture the physical dynamics of the system and metrics that measure the difference from the ground-truth result are included in the feedback section.
