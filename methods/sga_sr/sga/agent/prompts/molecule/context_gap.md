### Context

This is a 3D molecule design environment. The evaluation environment is a molecule property prediction model. The objective of this problem is to fill in a code block so that the result from executing the code minimizes the evaluation loss. The code block defines the structure of the designed molecule, which contains two parts:

1. The SMILES string describing the molecular topology structure and atomic types. Note that the SMILES string should not include hydrogens in the molecule.
2. The 3D coordinates of all atoms including hydrogens in the molecule. Not that the 3D coordinates should not include hydrogens in the molecule.

Note that (1) is a discrete variable that cannot be directly optimized using gradients, and (2) is a continuous parameter and can be optimized using differentiable optimization. The SMILE string stands for "Simplified Molecular-Input Line-Entry System". It can contain the following atoms: ['C', 'N', 'O', 'S', 'H', 'Cl', 'F', 'Br', 'I', 'Si', 'P', 'B', 'Na', 'K', 'Al', 'Ca', 'Sn', 'As', 'Hg', 'Fe', 'Zn', 'Cr', 'Se', 'Gd', 'Au', 'Li']. We are interested in designing molecule with a specific HOMO-LUMO energy gap. The energy difference between the HOMO and LUMO is the HOMOâ€“LUMO gap. Its size can be used to predict the strength and stability of transition metal complexes, as well as the colors they produce in solution. We will provide the following information in the feedback for further analysis and generation:

1. Desired HOMO-LUMO energy gap.
2. HOMO-LUMO energy gap of the original and optimized molecules
3. Losses used for training: HOMO-LUMO energy gap loss, conformer loss, and the total loss. The HOMO-LUMO energy gap loss characterizes the distance of the current molecular from the desired one, the lower the better. The conformer loss characterizes the uncertainty of the predictor about the accuracy of the result, the lower the better. The total loss is the weighted sum of these two losses.
4. The optimized 3D coordinates with respect to the loss.
