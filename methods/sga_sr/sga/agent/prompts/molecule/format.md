### Code Requirements

1. The programming language is always python.
2. Annotate the size of the tensor as comment after each tensor operation. For example, `# (B, 3, 3)`.
3. Separate the code into: (1) python string `SMILES`: the SMILES string describing the molecular topology structure and atomic types, and (2) matrix `coordinates` the 3D coordinates of all atoms. These representations should not include hydrogens.
4. The SMILES string should be valid. Use your knowledge about Simplified Molecular-Input Line-Entry System to help you design a valid one.
5. The number of atoms in the SMILES string should be no less than 8, which means the number of atoms should be >= 8. Try to generate molecule with diverse atoms.
6. The 3D coordinates of the atoms should not be overlapping with each other. In another word, every row in the matrix `coordinates` should be distinct from each other.
7. The `coordinates` matrix is of shape `(N, 3)` where `N` stands for the number of atoms in the molecule. It should be identical to the number of atoms that the proposed SMILES string represents. State out the shape of any matrix defined in the comment as shown in the following example. State out the number of atoms that the SMILES string represents in the comment as shown in the following example.
8. The discrete SMILES string is critical in this problem since it defines the structure and cannot be tuned using differentiable optimization. Please propose different SMILES string from all examples or iterations above to discover and evaluate more structure. This is very important.
9. The proposed code should strictly follow the structure and function signatures below:

```python
{code}
```

### Solution Requirements

1. Analyze step-by-step what the potential problem is in the previous iterations based on the feedback. Think about why the results from previous molecule structure mismatched with the ground truth. Do not give advice about how to optimize. Focus on the formulation of the SMILES string. Start this section with "### Analysis". Analyze all iterations individually, and start the subsection for each iteration with "#### Iteration N", where N stands for the index. Remember to analyze every iteration in the history.
2. Think step-by-step what you need to do in this iteration. Think about how to separate your algorithm into a continuous 3D coordinate system part and a discrete SMILES string part. Remember the SMILES string proposed should always be different from previous iterations. After propose the new SMILES string, compute and count step-by-step how many atoms it contains. The continuous parameter should follow the number of atoms in the SMILES string. Describe your plan in pseudo-code, written out in great detail. Start this section with "### Step-by-Step Plan".
3. Output the code in a single code block "```python ... ```" with detailed comments in the code block. After the SMILES string, compute the number of atoms in it by counting. Remember that the number of atoms in the SMILES string should be no less than 8, which means the number of atoms should be >= 8. Try to generate molecule with diverse atoms. Do not add any trailing comments before or after the code block. Start this section with "### Code".
