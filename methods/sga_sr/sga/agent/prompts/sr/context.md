### Context

The objective is to construct a mathematical expression that accurately maps input variables to a target output based on a provided dataset. The task involves filling in a code block to define a symbolic expression or model that minimizes the difference between predicted and ground-truth outputs. The code block defines a class with two functions: one for parameters within the expression and another for generating or modifying the symbolic structure of the expression. Feedback is provided in the form of metrics measuring the error between the modelâ€™s predictions and the ground-truth values, as well as guidance on structural improvements to the symbolic expression.
